## Multi-Agent Coding Assistant
This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to improve and execute coding tasks based on natural language input.
By leveraging multiple AI agents with specialized roles, the system provides a comprehensive approach to problem-solving,
from task refinement to code implementation and review.

## Features
Task refinement and enhancement
Project planning and design
Plan criticism and improvement
Code implementation
Code review and optimization
Final code polishing
Project summary generation

## Agents
Task Refinement Specialist
System Designer
Quality Assurance Auditor
Senior Coding Architect
Code Review Specialist
Content Summarization Specialist

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
Python 3.7+
pip (Python package manager)

## Usage
Run the main script:
When prompted, enter your coding task in natural language.
The system will process your request through multiple agents to refine, plan, implement, and optimize the solution.

## Acknowledgments
This project uses the CrewAI framework for agent coordination.
Groq API is used for language model interactions.
